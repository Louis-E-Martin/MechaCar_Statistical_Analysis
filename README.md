## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The varibles that had a noticble effect on the MPG in our mechaCar dataset where the Spolier angle, Weather it had AWD or not, and the vehical weight. The slope is not considered to be zero because our P value is well within the .05 range. The model does a decent job of predicting the mpg of cars with a R-squared value of .7149. This gives us confidence that we will be able to guess a realtivly accurate mpg for any car.\

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
From what we can see the variance is low enough overall to meet our 100 goal but lot three fails to complete this test with a variance above 100.


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
From our tests of the suspention coils we can see that only yhose made in lot three have a diffrent PSI then those in the genrall market.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
A study that could be run to compare MechaCars to the other car brands wouold be comparing the mpg to cost of the cars then comparing the MechaCar brands result to that of other car manifcatures. You would want to do this comparison on similar types of cars with similar engian sizes. For this test you could do a T test to find out if the cost/mpg is comparablie and to see if one has a better value. To run this test you would need the cost of cars, the types of car, and their mpg.
